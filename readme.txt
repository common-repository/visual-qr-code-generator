== Description ==

Visualead's Visual QR Code Generator makes QR Codes more effective by instantly and seamlessly blending them with any design, attracting users and increasing engagement.
QR Codes are the most popular way to lead users from print to mobile. They are all around us and
people are used to seeing and scanning them. Yet, they aren't attractive; they’re devoid of meaning and
simply don’t do the job well enough.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `visualead-widget` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Edit your settings under Visual QR menu
4.Place the widget under the desired location - default is sidebar
